      <h2>Using Swatches</h2>

      <p>
        Swatches provide sets of colors, both primaries and accents, based on the color theory behind Material Design. It is recommended
        that you select one primary and one accent color for your app, each with a normal, light and dark shade.
      </p>

      <p>
        The swatches are all exposed in two ways. One is through the
        <code>swatches</code> export on
        <code>@aurelia-ux/core</code>. The other is through CSS Variables that are created and injected into the document when the
        application starts up.
